3 sources of signals/noise:
  - (X) electronics [noise]
  - (Y) biological activity not related to experiment stimulus [noise]
  - (Z) biological activity related to experiment stimulus [signal]

3 Experiments:
  - Experimental condition (actually running the experiment)
      - Signal Components: X + Y + Z
  - Live animal control (live animal with light/audio blocked by cardboard/distance)
      - Signal Components: X + Y
  - Dead animal control (dead animal with lights/audio)
      - Signal Components: X

Evoked Potentials:
  - VEP: Visually Evoked Potential
  - SSVEP: Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential
      - 3 frequencies
  - SSAEP: Steady-State Auditory Evoked Potential
      - 3 frequencies
  - BAEP: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential
      - did not obtain any data
