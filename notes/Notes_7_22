endo electrodes on front
for vep also show 100 to 500 ms

vep late cut off -50 ms to 100 ms -- only show 100 - 500
vep - live and dead controls

Looks best:
  ssvep 40 Hz

    large signal at low freq = ???
    large signal at high freq = qrs complex from heart (especially lower down) and from hvac turning on
