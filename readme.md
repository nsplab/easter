The gui.py script can be used to call the other scripts, and that's the recommended way of launching them. The scripts are divided into VEP and AEP. There is also baseline_5m.py which is used to record a 5 minute baseline signal.
All the scripts write the recorded data in /media/ssd/ and currently this address is hardcoded, Mosalam will fix this in the new version so the addeess is in a common config file.
