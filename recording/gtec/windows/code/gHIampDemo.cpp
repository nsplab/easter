/* gHIampDemo.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
 *
 * This application reads data from exactly one g.HIamp device and writes received data to a binary output file ("receivedData.bin" in the working directory).
 * This binary output file can be read by using MATLAB for example. The file consists of consecutive float values (4 bytes each) that are the measured values in microvolts from the devices.
 * A single scan consists of one measured value (sample) for each channel, one following the other. The file contains a number of those scans, one complete scan following the other.
